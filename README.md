# Hi there üëãüèæ, My name is Tchissola Yasmin
My name is Tchissola Yasmin. I live in Angola and graduated from high school in the Year 2024. I took the Kaplan English Test in February 2025 and scored 543 (C2). I also got an overall Duolingo English test score of 130 in August 2024, and from TOEFL iBT in February 2025, I got 88 as an overall score, so I can consider myself fluent in English. I have also been learning Spanish since I was 12, so I am fluent in Spanish. So, I enjoy learning new languages, not only to talk to people but also to program computers; this is why I decided to expand my coding knowledge.

I usually code with Java, Python, and JavaScript, and I created this page to share some of my recent projects on the following REPLIT page:
